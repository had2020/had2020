### More stuff about me
I’ve been working on a full tech stack since high school, and I’ve built a bunch of projects using common technologies that very relevant nowadays. I’m particularly skilled in Rust backend development with I love using Rust the most, and Python, Flask, OpenAI, Tensorflow, torch, and Django. I’m also comfortable with frontend development using React JS, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve also used SQL databases in my projects and learned some handy SQLite tricks. Rust is always the best for me!

I’m a huge fan of technology, especially DIY tech! But on a more chill note, I’m also really into coding and learning new tech. I’d love to get a tech job where I could work with a team of awesome people.

### My history so far
# Getting Started: Middle School Beginnings
My coding journey began in **middle school**, where I learned **Python** and **Pygame** to create simple games. This sparked my passion for development, and by high school, I had released smaller games, including *Hyper Legends*, a multiplayer VR FPS using the **Photon API**.

---

# Expanding Skills: High School and VR Projects
In **high school**, I explored **Unreal Engine** for immersive VR projects with physics elements and used the lightweight **Godot engine** for mobile and VR games. During this time, I also led a **hackathon team**, building a backend with **Python Flask** to integrate databases and user accounts.

---

# Web Development: From Django to Full-Stack Projects
For web development, I created a **Django app** and a portfolio site with a blog documenting my coding progress. I later advanced to **React** and **Flask**, working on full-stack projects and refining my **tech stack**.

---

# Low-Level Programming: C/C++ and Rust
Diving into systems programming, I discovered a love for **C/C++** and quickly built a Vim-like text editor. This passion expanded to **Rust**, where I now explore its low-level power and versatility, and creating my own **Crates**.
