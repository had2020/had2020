### More stuff about me
I work on a full tech stack daily since highschool.
I made many projects all with common technologies, used in modern day projects.
I have experiance in Backend with Python, Flask, OpenAI, Tensorflow, torch, and Django.
I also have experiance in Frontend with React JS, and of course Html/Css and JS.
I have also used SQL databases in my projects and learned some handy SQL lite. 

I love technology ESPECIALLY DIY Tech! But on a calmer note I love coding and learning new technology. I would LOVE 
get a TECH JOB where I could work with many other people.

### My history so far
Throughout my coding journey, I've actively engaged in learning a variety of programming languages and technologies, continuously pushing my boundaries and exploring new possibilities. Starting with Python and Pygame in middle school, I developed a passion for game development and gradually progressed to more complex projects, including mobile games. By my third year, I had released several smaller games and even launched my first Real VR game, "Hyper Legends," a challenging multiplayer FPS game utilizing the Photon API. This project was a testament to my dedication and programming proficiency, given the complexity involved at the time.

As I began high school, I focused on mastering the Unreal Engine, which allowed me to create immersive VR experiences. I delved into complex code for multiplayer and VR environments, dedicating months to learning and refining these projects. By incorporating various physics elements and managing over 50 features in each project, I successfully crafted VR experiments that challenged me both intellectually and artistically.

In my first and second years of high school, I explored the Godot engine, appreciating its lightweight and scalable nature for VR and mobile games. While familiar with other game engines, I gravitated toward Godot due to its readability and adaptability to diverse projects. During this period, I also transitioned to learning Python for web development, creating a basic Django web app with a database.

I had the opportunity to participate in a hackathon, where I took on a leadership role, guiding newer developers through coding HTML/CSS for the frontend. I developed the backend using Python Flask, implementing a database-integrated account system and a chat system linked with user accounts. I also created web pages for my code while assisting others in building the codebase.

In the summer before my third year of high school, I focused on enhancing my skills by learning React and deepening my knowledge of the full tech stack. Currently, I am working on modern websites using React and Python Flask, continually refining my skills and setting new goals. My aim is to create a fully-featured hub for my existing tools and new developments, ultimately building a user base to support future innovations.
