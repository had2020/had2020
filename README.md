# My history so far
started coding in the beginging  of middleschool started with python and pygame. Then I moved to unity were I learned my first game engine. in the second year od middle school I experimented with relaseing some smaller games, in the third year of middle school I had a buch of pretty complex mobile games, and had released my first Real VR game called hyper lengends it was very complex for me at the time, hyper lengends was a multiplayer fps game, that used the photon api. I learned how to code off the internet, as well one unity class I took for a week. In the first year of highschool I switched to Unreal Engine, I stayed with Unreal engine for a while and made some cool VR Experments and learned more complex code, code that included multiplayer and VR, these games where very complex, offen including  lots of physics and 50 or more features, and toolk months to learn and make them. In my Second year off highschool I switched to Godot Engine. I switch because I wanted to have a lightwight engine, but one that had easy to read code, and that could scale to my project VR or a Mobile game. I still love the other game engines and know how the use the other engines as well. Thanks for your time, it is very valuable to me!
