# My history so far
I've been actively engaged in learning various programming languages, including Python and Pygame for beginners, as well as Unity for more advanced projects. Throughout my middle school years, I experimented with releasing smaller games and progressed to complex mobile games in the third year. Notably, I released my first Real VR game, "Hyper Lengends," which was a challenging multiplayer FPS game that utilized the Photon API. This accomplishment speaks to my dedication and proficiency in programming, especially given the complexity of the project at the time. 

I began my high school journey by focusing on the Unreal Engine, which allowed me to create immersive VR experiences and learn more complex code for multiplayer and VR environments. Over the course of several months, I dedicated time to learning and refining these projects, incorporating various physics aspects and managing over 50 features in each project. This commitment to honing my skills led to the successful creation of VR experiments that challenged me both intellectually and artistically.

During my second year of high school, I explored the Godot engine, which provided a lightweight alternative to more complex game engines while still allowing for scalable solutions for VR or mobile games. Although I appreciate and understand other game engines, my focus shifted towards the Godot engine due to its readability and adaptability to various projects. Thank you for sharing your valuable time with me!
