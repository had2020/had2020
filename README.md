### More stuff about me
I‚Äôve been working on a full tech stack since high school, and I‚Äôve built a bunch of projects using common technologies that very relevant nowadays. I‚Äôm particularly skilled in backend development with Python, Flask, OpenAI, Tensorflow, torch, and Django. I‚Äôm also comfortable with frontend development using React JS, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I‚Äôve also used SQL databases in my projects and learned some handy SQLite tricks. 

I‚Äôm a huge fan of technology, especially DIY tech! But on a more chill note, I‚Äôm also really into coding and learning new tech. I‚Äôd love to get a tech job where I could work with a team of awesome people.

### My history so far
Throughout my coding journey, I‚Äôve been on a mission to learn as many programming languages and technologies as possible. I‚Äôve always been curious about how things work, and I love pushing my limits and exploring new ideas.

It all started when I was in middle school. I was fascinated by game development, so I started learning Python and Pygame. I made a few simple games, and I was hooked! I kept learning and making more complex games, including mobile games. By my third year of high school, I had released several smaller games and even launched my first Real VR game, ‚ÄúHyper Legends.‚Äù It was a challenging multiplayer FPS game that used the Photon API. It was a big project, but I was proud of what I had accomplished.

As I got into high school, I wanted to learn more about creating immersive VR experiences. I started learning the Unreal Engine, which allowed me to make VR games that felt real. I spent months learning and working on these projects, and I was really impressed with what I could do. I even managed to incorporate some physics elements and manage over 50 features in each project. It was a lot of work, but it was also a lot of fun.

In my first and second years of high school, I also explored the Godot engine. I liked it because it was lightweight and scalable, making it a good choice for VR and mobile games. I was also familiar with other game engines, but I chose Godot because it was easy to read and adaptable to different projects.

During this time, I also started learning Python for web development. I created a basic Django web app with a database. It was a great way to learn Python and to get a feel for web development.

I also had the chance to participate in a hackathon, where I took on a leadership role and helped newer developers learn how to code HTML/CSS for the frontend. I also developed the backend using Python Flask, which allowed me to create a database-integrated account system and a chat system that was linked to user accounts. I also created web pages for my code while helping others build the codebase.

In the summer before my third year of high school, I focused on learning React and deepening my knowledge of the full tech stack. I‚Äôm currently working on modern websites using React and Python Flask, and I‚Äôm constantly refining my skills and setting new goals. My goal is to create a fully-featured hub for my existing tools and new developments, and I want to build a user base to support future innovations.
